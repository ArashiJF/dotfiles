# Bootstrap

The install sh will install most of the utilities needed that the other programs depend on:

```
./install.sh
```

After the install script is done, you will need to open an new terminal session. Afterwards, execute:

```
./initialize.sh
```

This will execute chezmoi to pull from the repo and apply the changes immediately.
